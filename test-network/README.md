Docker Testnet
==============

This directory contains a docker-compose configuration to run a basic 4-node Teku network.
The network uses the minimal spec and the mock-genesis protocol to generate a genesis state without 
needing an ETH1 chain.  The 64 validators are spread across the four nodes.

To start the network, run the `launch.sh` script in this directory.  
To stop, simply ctrl-C to kill the docker instances and then optionally run `docker-compose down` to remove all traces.

Metrics are available via Grafana at http://localhost:3001/ username is `admin` and password is `pass`.

Add a `ports:` section to any of the nodes to expose additional ports and access services from that node.
